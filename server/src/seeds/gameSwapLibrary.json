		"description": "<p>Super Mario Odyssey is a 3D platform game, a part of Nintendo’s Super Mario series. </p>\n<h3>Story</h3>\n<p>The game follows Mario on his quest to save Princess Peach from her forced marriage with Bowser. The game starts with Mario fighting Bowser on its aircraft. Bowers knock Mario off the ship and shreds his cap into pieces. Mario awakens in the Cap Kingdom inhabited with hat-like spirits and befriends one of them named Cappy. It turns out, Bowser also kidnapped Cappy’s sister Tiara, and now the heroes must chase Bowser through several kingdoms to save Peach and Tiara. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The gameplay of Super Mario Odyssey draws inspiration from Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine. The game consists 17 levels (named as “kingdoms”). In most of them, your goal is to collect a certain amount of Power Moons. Collecting enough of them allows the player to progress to the next kingdom. Some moons can be found in different parts of the level or acquired as a reward for completing certain tasks or challenges. The Mario’s moveset mostly resembles that of Super Mario 64 and includes wall jumps, triple jumps, somersaults, long jumps, rolling on the ground. The main new gameplay feature is that Mario can throw his hat to create temporary platforms, grab objects, attack enemies, or possess them. Possessing enemies gives you new moves and sometimes is necessary to reach certain parts of the level.</p>"

		"description": "<p>Donkey Kong 64 is a 1999 adventure platform video game for the Nintendo 64 console, and the first in the Donkey Kong series to feature 3D gameplay. As the gorilla Donkey Kong, the player explores the themed levels of an island to collect items and rescue his kidnapped friends from K. Rool. The player completes minigames and puzzles as five playable Kong characters—each with its own special abilities—to receive bananas and other collectibles. In a separate multiplayer mode, up to four players can compete in deathmatch and last man standing games.<br />\nRare, who had previously developed the Donkey Kong Country games, began development on the 3D Donkey Kong in 1997. A 16-person team, with many members recruited from Rare&#39;s Banjo group, finished the game in 1999, when it was published by Nintendo for North America in November and worldwide by December. It was the first game to require the Nintendo 64 console&#39;s Expansion Pak, an accessory that added memory resources. The game had an exceptionally large marketing budget that included advertisements, sweepstakes, and a national tour.<br />\nThe game received universal acclaim from reviewers and was Nintendo&#39;s top seller during the 1999 holiday season, with 2.3 million units sold by 2004. It won the 1999 E3 Game Critics award for Best Platform Game, and multiple awards and nominations from games magazines. Reviewers noted the game&#39;s exceptional size and length, but criticized its emphasis on item collection and backtracking. Some cited its similarity in gameplay and visuals to Rare&#39;s 1998 predecessor, Banjo-Kazooie, despite Donkey Kong 64&#39;s mandatory memory add-on. The game&#39;s camera controls also frustrated reviewers. Critics felt that the game did not meet the revolutionary potential of Donkey Kong Country, but remained among the best 3D platform games on the console.<br />\nDonkey Kong 64 is remembered as the emblematic example of Rare&#39;s &quot;collect-a-thon&quot; adventure platformers for the tedium of its collection tasks. A rap song from the game&#39;s introductory sequence—the DK Rap—is often cited among the worst songs to feature in a video game. The title was later released on Nintendo&#39;s Wii U Virtual Console in 2015.</p>"

Master Chief must repel the Covenant assault and discover the secrets of Halo with the assistance of the female AI Cortana who lives in his suit and gives missions.</p>\n<p>Halo: Combat Evolved is a sci-fi first-person shooter with considerable driving elements. Features include friendly NPCs who fight alongside the Chief, squad-based AI where enemies groups work together to flank you under the direction of a leader unit and can be demoralized by his death. They also use cover, set ambushes, etc.</p>\n<p>Only two weapons may be carried at a time: one active and one on backup. There are five human weapons and three Covenant with distinct art styles for the two groups. Human weapons look basically like real guns and fire projectiles. Covenant are sleek and purple and fire energy. For the most part, weapons are not just left around the environment and must be procured from fallen enemies though there are supply points.</p>\n<p>Your life is armor and health as in most games of the genre, however, rather than armor being an item that is picked up, it is a force field which quickly recharges itself after several seconds without taking damage, which emphasizes finding cover.</p>\n<p>One of the most significant features is vehicles. You can drive a variety of vehicles in both single-player and multiplayer, some of which have additional seats for passengers or gunners which can be used by AI characters. Vehicles also come in distinct human and Covenant varieties with their design philosophies. Human vehicles roll around the ground on wheels and covenant vehicles hover or fly.</p>\n<p>Halo also has a significant multiplayer component with basic deathmatch (called slayer here), capture the flag with the unusual addition that the flag takes your weapon spot while you are holding it, so shooting your way in and out of the base on your own is not an option, territories, and some options unique to the game, such as oddball, where you must hold onto a skull for the longest time, race where you score points by getting to checkpoints and juggernaut, where one super-powered player must get points by killing the others and the other players try to kill him to steal his powers. There is also a game editor which allows you to set custom rules for all the basic game types. All the playable weapons and vehicles from the campaign mode are available in the multiplayer maps with the ability for members of the same team to share the game&#39;s distinctive Warthog vehicle, which is essentially a small truck with a mounted gun on the back.</p>"

Sonic decides to hinder Robotnik’s plans by freeing animals and collecting the emeralds himself.  </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game consists of six zones each of which is divided into three acts. In the first two acts, your goal is to reach the finish while the third act ends with a boss fight against Dr. Robotnik. After completing the sixth zone, you enter the Final Zone which consists of one act and the final battle against Robotnik. The level in the game is usually relatively roomy and implicate various ways of completing. The gameplay is centered on Sonic’s ability to run at high speed. Thereby the levels involve many slopes, loops, springs. Sonic can use Spin Attack to attack enemies or destroy certain obstacles.<br />\nThe Spin Attack can be activated by gaining high speed while rolling on the ground or jumping. The players’ health depends on the main collectibles of the game – golden rings placed throughout the levels and collecting one hundred of them gives you an extra life.
